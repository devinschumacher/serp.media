<br>

When it comes to talk shows, Primetime Glick is anything but ordinary. Hosted by the delightfully rude Jiminy Glick, this series turns everyday interviews into comedy gold. From its debut in 2001 to its conclusion in 2003, Primetime Glick proved that talking about nothing - and making guests feel like they're part of an exclusive club of the clueless - could be incredibly entertaining.

She can predict your future, just not hers.

<br>

Maggie, a psychic, regularly sees the future of those around her - friends, family, and even strangers on the street. But when she glimpses her own future, it forces her to confront her present. As she navigates this new reality, Maggie learns that predicting the future is much easier than living in the moment.

## 42. [Tattingers](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/github/amazon/Tattingers)

<br>

When an hour-long comedy-drama fails to connect with audiences in the fall of 1988, NBC reinvents it as a half-hour situation comedy the following spring. Tattingers, the story of Nick and Hillary, proves that sometimes all it takes to find your footing is to change your approach.

<br>

When an ex-girlfriend casts a wicked spell, Steven Weber's life turns into a non-stop stream of bad luck - until NBC decides to rewrite reality. Midway through this short-lived 2000 series, the network pulls a switcheroo, dropping the magical premise and turning it into a more traditional sitcom. Despite the makeover, the show fizzles out after just one season, leaving viewers to wonder what Liz Phair's theme song really meant.
