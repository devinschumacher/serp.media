<br>

When an ex-girlfriend casts a wicked spell, Steven Weber's life turns into a non-stop stream of bad luck - until NBC decides to rewrite reality. Midway through this short-lived 2000 series, the network pulls a switcheroo, dropping the magical premise and turning it into a more traditional sitcom. Despite the makeover, the show fizzles out after just one season, leaving viewers to wonder what Liz Phair's theme song really meant.
