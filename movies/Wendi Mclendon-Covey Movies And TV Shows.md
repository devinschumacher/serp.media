Before becoming the lovable yet eccentric Deputy Clementine Johnson on Reno 911! , Wendi McLendon-Covey was just another aspiring actress living in the great state of Texas. Her big break came in 2011 with a memorable role in Bridesmaids, followed by standout performances in films like What to Expect When You're Expecting and The Single Moms Club. When she's not entertaining audiences on the big screen, you might recognize her voice as Monica Rappaccini on Marvel's M. O. D. O. K. or Nancy Green on Big City Greens.
