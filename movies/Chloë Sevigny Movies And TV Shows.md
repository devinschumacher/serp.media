"Get Rid of Yourself" is a video-film-tract that emerged from the political unrest of the 2001 G8 counter-summit in Genoa.

Through a deliberately fragmented approach that plays with sound/image disjunctions and cheap video effects, the film declares its own exile from a biopolitical space-time where nothing ever happens - announcing a crisis of history itself, but this time without characters or a story.
