Good man. Cop. Killer.

In this 10-episode Detroit drama, a detective's carefully constructed alibi for murdering a fellow officer draws him into the underworld he's spent his career fighting against. As perfect as his crime may seem, the consequences will forever change not just his life, but his very identity within the force.
