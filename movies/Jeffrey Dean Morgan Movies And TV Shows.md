## 39. [Extreme](https://serp.ly/amazon/Extreme)

<br>

In January 1995, ABC introduced Extreme, a series set in the Rocky Mountains that focused on search and rescue operations. With James Brolin in the lead, the show appeared destined to become a compelling adventure series. However, it struggled to find an audience and was canceled after seven episodes. This failure led the major networks to change their post-Super Bowl programming approach, moving away from launching new series in favor of other strategies.
