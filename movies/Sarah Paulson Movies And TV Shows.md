When NBC's beloved Thursday night lineup got a little bolder in early 2002, they did it with style. Right after "Friends" said goodbye to viewers at 8:30 PM, this single-camera comedy jumped into action - and what an action it was. In just six episodes, "Leap of Faith" proved itself a fearless addition to the primetime lineup, earning top-15 ratings and bringing 16.5 million viewers along for the ride. It's a shame it had to end so soon, but what a way to go out: with nerves of steel and a sense of humor that still shines through in the reruns.
