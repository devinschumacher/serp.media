When a Burbank production company repurposed stand-up comedy for cable TV, they created something entirely their own. Using the affordable Squigglevision software, Jonathan Katz and Tom Snyder transformed static jokes into dynamic animations. Their collaboration resulted in a unique six-season series that aired on Comedy Central from 1995 to 2002, proving that sometimes the most innovative solutions come from combining the right people with the right technology.
