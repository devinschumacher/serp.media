## 69. [Family Album](https://serp.ly/amazon/Family+Album)

<br>

When Fox needed a midseason replacement for Glee in 2011, they turned to Joe Port and Joe Wiseman to create something new. The result was Family Album, a single-camera comedy pilot that briefly entertained the network before being shelved. While it never made it to series, the project represents a moment in time when American television was hungry for fresh comedies to fill its schedule.
