When NBC's beloved Thursday comedy block lineup changed in early 2002, a new half-hour series took its place after Friends. Leap of Faith, airing from February to April that year, brought a fresh twist to the network's lineup. Despite ranking 12th for the season and averaging 16.5 million viewers per episode, the single-camera comedy lasted only six episodes. This brief run made it one of the highest-rated shows to be cancelled, leaving viewers to wonder what could have been.
