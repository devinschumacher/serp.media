When renegade filmmaker Robert Altman teamed up with Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Garry Trudeau in 1988, they created something entirely their own. Running a fictional presidential candidate alongside the real hopefuls, this miniseries became a groundbreaking blend of soap opera and political commentary. What began as an unconventional experiment evolved into a sharp satire on media-age American politics, proving that the race for the presidency is as much about storytelling as it is about policy.
