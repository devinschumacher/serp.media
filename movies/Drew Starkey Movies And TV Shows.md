When the pandemic hit in 2020, Brando Crawford turned to theater - not the kind that happens in empty studios, but the live kind that brings people together through storytelling. With young Hollywood talent like Florence Pugh and Margaret Qualley answering the call, this series of classic plays and screen readings became more than just entertainment - it became a movement. Each performance, carefully directed and produced, raised money for charity while proving that great stories and talented actors can create something truly special, even in the most challenging circumstances.
