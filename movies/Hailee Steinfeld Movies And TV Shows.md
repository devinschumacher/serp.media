When the Gunderson boys' father goes to prison, they hire a charming schemer named Ron Snuffkin to stand in as their father figure. This unconventional arrangement evolves from a simple business relationship to something far more complex, with Ron drawing on his vast array of skills to care for the quirky family. As an ongoing chess match unfolds between Ron and the boys, neither side can afford to give up too much power or independence in this single-season comedy.
