Designed to keep you laughing!

<br>

When four very different women run a design firm together, their personalities turn everyday situations into comedy. Julia Sugarbaker, the bold and opinionated owner, works alongside Mary Jo Shively, the single mom who's nearly as strong-willed but lacks confidence; Charlene Frazier-Stillfield, the naive farm girl from Missouri; and Suzanne Sugarbaker, the self-centered former beauty queen with a history of wealthy ex-husbands. Their personal quirks and shared experiences make every day at Sugarbaker and Associates something new.
