Because "Convention Man" doesn't sound as cool

<br>

When "Spectrum" unexpectedly disappears from the small screen, leaving behind only 25 episodes, it transforms from an ordinary sci-fi show into a fan favorite. Co-star Wray Nerely, who plays alongside the now-famous Jack Moore, reluctantly joins him at conventions and pop culture events across the country. What unfolds is a rollercoaster of experiences, both expected and bizarre, that challenge everything they thought they knew about their post-show lives.
