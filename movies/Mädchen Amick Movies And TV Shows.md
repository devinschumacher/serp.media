Travel back to a Los Angeles that's just beginning to heal from the scars of World War II, where the neon lights cast long shadows and secrets run as deep as the Hollywood Hills. This neo-noir anthology series doesn't just tell stories - it dives into the dark heart of human experience, where nothing and no one are quite what they seem. It's a journey through the twisting streets of a city that's forever changing, yet somehow remains the same.
